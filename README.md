# Tutorial for Topological Matter School - 2023

# Overview

The tutorial will teach how to numericaly evaluate magnetotransport (within semiclassical formalism)  and optical properties. Or any other quantity which can be expressed as a Brillouin zonde integral. We will use the code WannierBerri (https://wannier-berri.org/). This code was primarily developed for ab-initio calculations of Berry curvatures and similar quantities (see paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-021-00498-5) 
but now it can be equally used for **k.p** or **tight-binding** models. We will **stick to the models** in the tutorial.  

The tutorials will be provided as Jupyter notebooks (https://jupyter.org/) and will de uploaded to this repository 
shortly before the session. So far the students are asked only to prepare their computers 

# Installation


First, tutrial is using `python3` language. Therefore, please install it on your computer (if not installed yet) 
It usually comes with a package manager `pip` . With this please install Jupyter Notebook, WanierBerri and also pythtb

```
pip install "wannierberri>=0.14.0"  pythtb notebook
```

This will also install all dependencies

pythtb (https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/index.html) is a package that we will use to construct tight-binding models.


# If you have problems 

* open an Issue in this repository (you need to login)
* look through issues in main repository https://github.com/wannier-berri/wannier-berri/issues
* try to find me at the school (I will be around) or some of the following people:
